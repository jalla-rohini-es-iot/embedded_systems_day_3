Day 3 – Control Flow,Decision Making in C and while loop
-Today I learned and practiced important control flow concepts,loops in C programming to improve my logic-building skills.
-What I learned : 
*How to read a set of data using user input
*Usage of the while loop for repeated execution
*Working of if–else statements for decision making 
*Use of conditional (ternary) operators as an alternative to if–else
*Concept of trailer value to stop input reading
*Counting techniques using loops 
*Implementation of a structured read loop 
*Selecting one of two alternatives based on conditions
-Practical Work : 
.Wrote C programs using while loops
.Implemented programs using if–else conditions 
.Solved problems using conditional operators 
.Practiced programs based on trailer value and counting logic
--Key Takeaway : 
Control flow statements help in making programs dynamic and logical
Proper use of loops and conditions improves problem-solving skills
